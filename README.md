## Tax calculator in 3021

### Imagine..

You are in 3021.
Earth has moved so much that we, *human beings* started doing business with *clueless doings* living in planet **Kepler**, not very far from Earth.


Don't worry! They too use the same number system...

So we gonna build a tax calculator system for the world in 3021.


##### Ready???

Earth charges sales tax as 10% for all the goods.
But just with any tax calculation system in the universe, this is not that easy.

We charge less i.e. 8% for the food items. But, this is not applicable for the food items imported from Kepler.

Apart from basic sales tax for any item that is imported from Kepler, Earth charges 3.23% additional import duty. However, as Earth lacks water and it's a basic need, the import duty is waived off on that. But make sure it appears as waived off in the receipt with name "Water waive-off".

As the Earth has not become a cashless economy yet, make sure the total value of the receipt is rounded off to nearest integer. Always round up. i.e if the amount is 13.01, output as 14.

The system Product details and outputs the receipt. Assume details by yourself.

Do not worry about input processing.

PS: BTW, *clueless doings* speak Tamil ;)
